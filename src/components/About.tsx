          Hi!, My name is Ivan , I'm graduated from a 4 month bootcamp in which
          I committed myself to learning for 8â€“10 hours daily per week,
          dedicating time to workshops and team projects using the agile SCRUM
          methodology and organizing ourselves with Trello. During my
          participation in the bootcamp, I had the opportunity to do a
          Professional practice of 1 month with Ceibo Digital.

          My passion for programming arose from When I was 17 years old, I
          decided to develop my first web page using HTML and CSS. This
          experience motivated me to seek a more solid formation in the
          programming field so I joined a bootcamp with the aim of
          professionalizing and acquire knowledge of good practices as well as
          learn how to work in a development team
